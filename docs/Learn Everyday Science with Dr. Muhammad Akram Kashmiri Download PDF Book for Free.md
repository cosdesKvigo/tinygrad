The book is divided into 20 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of science. The chapters are organized in a logical sequence, starting from the smallest unit of matter (atom) and ending with the largest structure in the universe (galaxy). Each chapter begins with an introduction that gives an overview of the topic and its importance. Then, the chapter presents the main concepts and facts related to the topic, along with examples and diagrams. The chapter ends with a summary that highlights the key points and a quiz that tests the reader's understanding.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise manner, avoiding unnecessary jargon and technical terms. The book also provides practical applications and interesting facts that make the learning process more engaging and fun. The book is suitable for students of grade 6 to 10, as well as anyone who wants to learn more about science and its relevance to our lives.
 
Everyday Science By Akram Kashmiri is a useful and informative book that can help readers develop a scientific attitude and curiosity. The book can also serve as a reference guide for teachers and parents who want to teach or revise science concepts with their children or students. The book is available in PDF format online and can be downloaded for free from various websites.
  
One of the strengths of the book is that it covers a wide range of topics and disciplines in science, giving the reader a comprehensive and holistic view of the natural world. The book also explains the interconnections and interdependencies among different branches of science, showing how they complement and enrich each other. For example, the book shows how physics and chemistry are related to biology and how biology and astronomy are related to environmental science.
 
Another strength of the book is that it uses everyday examples and situations to illustrate the scientific concepts and principles. The book shows how science is not only a theoretical subject, but also a practical and useful one that can help us solve problems and improve our lives. For example, the book shows how heat transfer affects cooking and refrigeration, how light reflection affects vision and mirrors, how sound waves affect communication and music, how electricity and magnetism affect appliances and devices, how chemistry affects food and medicine, how biology affects health and disease, how astronomy affects time and seasons, and how environmental science affects climate and resources.
 
A possible limitation of the book is that it may not cover some of the latest developments and discoveries in science, as it was published in 2010. The book may also not go into much depth or detail on some of the topics, as it is intended for a general audience. However, these limitations do not diminish the value and quality of the book, as it still provides a solid foundation and overview of science that can spark further interest and exploration among the readers.

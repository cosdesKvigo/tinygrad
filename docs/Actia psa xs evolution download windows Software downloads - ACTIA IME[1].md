## Step 3: Select the files you want to protect
 
In this step, you have to browse your computer and select the files you want to protect. You can add multiple files or folders by clicking on the "Add" button. You can also remove any file or folder from the list by clicking on the "Remove" button.
 
After you have selected all the files you want to protect, click on "Next".
 
## Step 4: Choose a protection method
 
In this step, you have to choose one of the two protection methods available: file protection or video protection. File protection encrypts your files and makes them unreadable without a valid serial number. Video protection encrypts your video files and prevents them from being played on other devices or software.
 
For this tutorial, we will choose file protection. Click on "File Protection" and then click on "Next".
 
## Step 5: Configure the file protection settings
 
In this step, you have to configure some settings for the file protection method. You can choose whether to encrypt your files or not, whether to create dummy files or not, and whether to use a serial number or not.
 
Encryption makes your files more secure, but it also increases the size of the protected media. Dummy files are fake files that are added to the protected media to confuse copying software and hackers. Serial number is a unique code that is required to access your protected files.
 
For this tutorial, we will enable encryption, create 10 dummy files and use a serial number. You can also customize the serial number format and length by clicking on the "Serial Number Settings" button.
 
After you have configured the file protection settings, click on "Next".
 
## Step 6: Create an ISO file or burn directly to a CD/DVD/BD
 
In this final step, you have to choose whether to create an ISO file or burn directly to a CD/DVD/BD. An ISO file is an image file that contains all the data of your protected media. You can save it on your computer or transfer it to another device. You can also burn it later to a CD/DVD/BD using any burning software.
 
Burning directly to a CD/DVD/BD means that WTM Copy Protection will write your protected data directly to a blank disc. You need a CD/DVD/BD writer and a blank disc for this option.
 
For this tutorial, we will create an ISO file. Click on "Create ISO File" and then choose a name and a location for your ISO file. Then, click on "Create".
 
## Congratulations! You have successfully protected your software with WTM Copy Protection 8cf37b1e13

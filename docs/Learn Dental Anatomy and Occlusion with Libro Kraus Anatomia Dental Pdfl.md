In this book, you will find detailed descriptions and illustrations of the morphology, structure, function and development of the human teeth and their supporting tissues. You will also learn about the principles and concepts of occlusion, the relationship between the teeth and the jaws, and the factors that affect occlusal stability and harmony.
 
The book covers both the primary (deciduous) and permanent dentitions, as well as the variations and anomalies that may occur in different individuals. It also provides clinical applications and implications of dental anatomy and occlusion for various dental specialties, such as orthodontics, prosthodontics, periodontics, endodontics and oral surgery.
 
*Libro Kraus Anatomia Dental Pdfl* is a valuable resource for dental students, practitioners and educators who want to enhance their knowledge and skills in dental anatomy and occlusion. It is written in a clear and concise language, with numerous tables, diagrams, photographs and radiographs to facilitate learning and understanding. It is also available in PDF format for easy access and convenience.

One of the main topics covered in *Libro Kraus Anatomia Dental Pdfl* is the classification of occlusion. Occlusion is the relation between the surfaces of the mandibular and maxillary teeth at rest and while in function. In other words, it is the contact between teeth[^3^]. Occlusion is an integral part of dental treatment as dentists cannot repair, move or remove teeth without affecting occlusion[^4^].
 
The book uses Angle's classification system to describe the different types of occlusion and malocclusion. This system is based on how the maxillary and mandibular first molars come into contact with one another when closing the teeth. There are three main classes: Class I (orthognathic), Class II (retrognathic) and Class III (prognathic). Class II can have two divisions: Division I (protruded anterior teeth) and Division II (retruded maxillary anterior teeth)[^2^]. The book also explains the variations and modifications of Angle's system, such as subdivisions, rotations, transpositions and cusp-to-cusp relationships.
 
Another important topic covered in *Libro Kraus Anatomia Dental Pdfl* is the anatomy and physiology of the masticatory system. The masticatory system comprises the teeth, the periodontal tissues and the articulatory system. The articulatory system is in itself a triumvirate comprising the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), muscles of mastication and associated nerves[^4^]. The book provides detailed information on the structure, function and development of each component of the masticatory system, as well as their interrelationships and clinical implications.
